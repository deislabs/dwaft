# Dwaft, the WebAssembly Dev Tool

Dwaft is a WebAssembly (WASM) developer tool for easily starting, building, debugging, and

TODO, but in progress

## Where does the name come from?
Dwaft comes from some nods to some technology and some pop culture. If you are new to the WASM
space, you'll quickly note that there are so. many. W. acronyms. One of our previous projects is
called [Draft](https://github.com/Azure/draft) and filled a similar role in the container/Kubernetes
space. We wanted to give a nod to that and the W, so we took a page from [this
